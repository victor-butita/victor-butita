ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Victor Butita, a passionate software engineer specializing in both web development and system design. I am the founder of Techworx Consultancy, where we provide consultation services and software solutions tailored to meet client needs.

ðŸ‘€ I love building robust and scalable web applications using PHP on the backend, combined with modern frontend technologies to create intuitive and user-friendly interfaces. On the other hand, I focus on system design and API development using Vuejs, C# & Java, where I work on creating efficient architectures, developing enterprise-grade systems, and ensuring they are scalable and secure.

ðŸŒ± Currently, Iâ€™m continuously refining my skills in PHP for web development, while deepening my expertise in system design and development using Vuejs, C# & Java. Additionally, Iâ€™m exploring data analytics with Power BI and Python to extract valuable insights that drive data-informed decisions.

ðŸ’¼ Iâ€™m open to collaboration opportunities on both web development projects involving PHP, as well as system design and development projects using Vuejs,Java & C#. Whether itâ€™s creating a new web application, developing APIs, optimizing codebases, or delving into data analysis, Iâ€™m excited to contribute my expertise.
