ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Victor Butita, a passionate software engineer specializing in backend development using PHP. I am the founder of Techworx Consultancy, where we provide consultation services and software solutions. 

ðŸ‘€ I love building robust and scalable web applications that leverage the power of PHP on the backend, combined with modern frontend technologies to create intuitive and user-friendly interfaces.

ðŸŒ± Currently, I'm continuously honing my skills in PHP development and exploring new frontend frameworks and libraries to stay up-to-date with the latest trends in web development. Additionally, I'm delving deeper into data analytics using Power BI tools and Python to extract valuable insights and drive data-informed decisions.

ðŸ’¼ I'm open to collaboration opportunities on projects involving PHP development, frontend design and development, and data analytics. Whether it's building a new web application, optimizing existing codebases, or diving into data analysis projects, I'm eager to contribute my expertise and collaborate with like-minded individuals.

ðŸ“« You can reach me via email at techworx.consultancy@gmail.com or connect with me on LinkedIn. Feel free to reach out if you'd like to discuss potential collaborations or have any questions.

ðŸ˜„ Fun fact: When I'm not coding, you can find me exploring new hiking trails, experimenting with new recipes in the kitchen, or cheering for my favorite soccer team.

âš¡ Let's build something amazing together and make an impact in the world of software development!
